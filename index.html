            <p>Hello! I'm Kevin, I'm a student at Basecamp Coding Academy. I like video games, listening to music, and driving. I'm excited to start learning HTML and CSS to start developing my own webpages. I think it will be a fun experience incorporating webpages into future projects.</p>

            <p>I have a number of different hobbies. I love to play video games, for example, some of my favorites are Minecraft, Roblox, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Dead by Daylight. As of now, Dead by Daylight has gotten my attention a lot more than the other games. Apart from those games, I have tried a new one recently. It's Cult of the Lamb. A friend introduced me to it; at first I thought I might not like it, but turns out I do. It's currently in my wishlist for games.</p>

            <h2>Music & Social Media</h2>
            <p>Music is a very big thing in my life. I enjoy listening to it while driving, doing work, or just casually. I would like to learn a few instruments so I could play some of my favorite songs. I can currently play the drums and I know a little bit of bass guitar. I hope to learn the electric guitar at some point.</p>

            <p>Social media is something I find myself on constantly. It takes a fair amount of my screen time; TikTok is one of my favorite social media apps. It's filled with funny videos that I love to repost and share with friends. It also can act like a news app, letting me know what's been going on around the world.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Movies</h2>
            <ol class="movies-list">
                <li>Smile 2</li>
                <li>Oppenheimer</li>
                <li>Alien Romulus</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is a list of some recent movies that I enjoyed a lot. Smile 2 is a horror movie that I will always remember due to the certain random jumpscares it has; I had also went with friends to see it. After the room was done, we all decided to get food. One friend was shocked at his experience with it; he later told us that it was his first horror movie.</p>

            <p>Oppenheimer is one of my favorites due to its stunning visuals and storytelling. The movie really puts you in the mind of the main character. Another thing I remember this movie for is the other, very popular, movie that was being shown the same time as Oppenheimer. The Barbie movie; these two movies were polar opposites and there was a lot of memes online about it.</p>

            <p>Alien Romulus is another good movie I remember watching. I went to see it with friends, and this was the first alien movie I had seen. At first my expectations were low, but after I was very surprised at how good it was. The pacing was good, the visuals were better, and it did have me on the edge of my seat in some moments. I also learned some fun trivia about the movie: they had actually got a former basketball player named Robert Bobroczkyi to play a creature in the show. Robert is a very tall guy, so he made a perfect candidate to play this creature.</p>
