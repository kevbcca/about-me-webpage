        <p> I have a number of different hobbies. I love to play video games for example, some of my favorites are minecraft, roblox, overwatch, fortnite, and dead by deadlight. As of now, dead by daylight has gotten my attention alot more than the other games.
            Apart from those games, I have tried a new one recently. It's Cult of the Lamb. A friend introducted me to it, at first I thought I might not like it, but turns out I do. Its currently in my wishlist for games.

        <p> Music is a very big thing in my life. I enjoy listening to it while driving, doing work, or just casually. I would like to learn to a few instruments so I could play a some of my favorite songs. I can currently play the drums and I know a little bit of bass guitar.
            I hope to learn the electric guitar at some point.

        <p> Social media is something I find myelf on constantly. It takes a fair amount of my screen time, tik tok is one of my favorite social media apps. Its filled with funny videos that I love to repost and share with friends. It also can act like a news app, letting me know
            whats been going on around the world.

        <h2> Favorite movies - </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Smile 2</li>
                <li> Oppenheimer</li>
                <li> Alien Romulus</li>
            </ol>
        <p> This is a list of some recent movies that I enjoyed alot. Smile 2 is a horror movie that I will always remember due to the certain random jumpscares it has, I had also went with friends too see it. After the room was done, we all decided to get food, one friend was
            shocked at his experience with it, he later told us that is was his first horror movie.

        <p> Oppenheimer is one of my favorite due to its stunning visuals and story telling. The movie really puts you in the mind of the main character. Another thing I remember this move a lot for is the other, very popular, movie that was being shown the same time as Oppenhiemer.
            The Barbie movie, this two movies were polar opposites and there was alot of memes online about it.

        <p> Alien Romulus is another good movie I remember watching. I had went to see it with friends, and this was the first alien movie I had seen. At first my expectations were low, but after it was very surprise at how good it was. The pacing was good, the visuals were better
            and it did have me on the edge of my seat in some moments. I also learned some fun trivia about the moive, they had actually got this a former basketball player named Robert Bobroczkyi to play a creatue in the show. Robert is a very tall guy, so he made a perfect candidate
            to play this creature.
