        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>The Holehearted Giving team is located at Yamal Peninsula, in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Russia. Donations are accepted daily at Holehearted Giving.<br>
        Just look for the hand-painted sign that says 'Toss here for good.' Bring cash, coins, or even checks in a sealed envelope—
        our volunteer team will make sure it takes the plunge safely.<br><br>
        Can't make it in person? Use our official 'Virtual Hole'—simply visit our website, aim your phone towards the center, and toss! Don't worry about your device, it will land safely and your money will fall with all the same satisfying plunk sound.</p>
