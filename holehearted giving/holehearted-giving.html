        <p class="subtitle">We're The Holehearted Giving Organization. A charity with one simple mission: We throw your donations into the our community's sink hole, where people in need can reach in and claim them.
        Every contribution is safe, secure, and accounted for, even if it takes a gravity-assisted journey to get there. And one day, with enough generosity,
        we might just fill this hole -literally- turning a once safetly hazzard into a symbol of hope.

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>We accept donations in any form of currency, including cash, check, credit card, and more. Once we have received your donation we drop the funds straigh into the hole. Locals in need are free
            to collect the money directly, no middleman, no red tape - just gravity doing its job. We keep careful records to make sure every dollar is accounted for, and the hole is monitored so donations
            are safe until claimed. Over time, as generosity grows, we'll not only be helping people but also work towards filling the hole itself, turning every contribution into both immediate relief and
            a step toward lasting change.
